# misc_work
This is a collection of code snippets I've created during my career, that I've developed on my own time and for which I have sole ownership.  I am making them available to anyone because people have helped me learn along the years and I want to help others learn, too.

Most of the files here are in Verilog, SystemVerilog, TCL, Python.

They are available for free for anyone (read the license) and if you make improvements, please let me know so I can improve my own codebase.
